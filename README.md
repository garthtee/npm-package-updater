# npm-package-updater README

npm-package-updater automatically checks the most up-to-date latest version of each dependency in your `package.json` file (both dependencies and devDependencies).

When you run the extension it will check if you like to create a backup of your `package.json` file. If you use git or another version control system you shouldn't need this.

## Features

Describe specific features of your extension including screenshots of your extension in action. Image paths are relative to this README file.

> Tip: Many popular extensions utilize animations. This is an excellent way to show off your extension! We recommend short, focused animations that are easy to follow.

## Requirements

This will only work with Javascript projects that contain a `package.json` file.

## Release Notes

Users appreciate release notes as you update your extension.

### 1.0.0

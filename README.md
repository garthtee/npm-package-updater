# npm-package-updater

NPM Package Updater automatically checks the most up-to-date latest version of each dependency in your `package.json` file (both dependencies and devDependencies).

When you run the extension it will check if you like to create a backup of your `package.json` file. If you use git or another version control system you shouldn't need this.

## Features

To run an update on all your dependencies run the `Update All Latest: NPM Package Updater` command from your [command palette](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/userinterface#_command-palette). You will need to reinstall your package once complete by running `npm install` in your terminal.

## Release Notes
